<p>The principles of calm robotics (short version):</p>
<ol><li><p><strong>Project a Sense of Presence.</strong> &mdash; The robot's "presence" is the highest priority of its design. When it is switched on, a human should not feel alone in the room. When it is switched off, it should still be appealing to have around.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Maintain an Inner Life.</strong> &mdash; A robot with an inner life can engage the outer world on those terms, and do so convincingly. This allows it to approach companionship from a position of strength. When switched on, the robot should have schedules or patterns that don't require active effort or engagement on your part, except that of hooking it up to power.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reward Focused Attention.</strong> &mdash; It's not enough to be entirely self-directed; the robot should also respond positively to attention. When switched on, it should reward focused attention beyond the benefits of "presence" mentioned above.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do Not Reinforce Bad Behavior.</strong> &mdash; The robot should not be capable of extended pain or distress. When mistreated or misused, it should respond negatively first, and if the behavior continues, cut off interactions and revert to an object state. (More on this later.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Spying.</strong> &mdash; Regardless of its technical abilities, it should not transmit or report any information to a third party which is not present. This holds true whether the third party is a parent, the company that built it, or a business partner of that company. When it's with you, it's on your side.</p></li></ol>
