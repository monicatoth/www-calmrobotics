<p>Calm robotics arose out of a few central observations:</p>
<h2><div class="inline_ornament"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#x00A9;</span> </div>&emsp;&emsp;Embodiment is hard, and we're not getting it right.</h2>
<p>Most people who think of robots have a physical object in mind, or at least a thing that <em>includes</em> a physical 'body' among its systems. Being embodied systems ourselves, we tend to prefer and respond to other bodies; but we also know exactly how other bodies 'should' behave and react, especially to simple stimuli like light and touch. For robotic bodies to meet these expectations, they need sensors (<em>lots</em> of sensors) and incredibly intricate programming.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, the commercial robots we see today struggle to meet these standards, especially when they're shaped like creatures we recognize. By building robots in simpler bodies (e.g. a plant or a snail instead of a cat), we're more likely to satisfy our built-in expectations and limit the types of complex interactions that will only generate disappointment.</p>
<h2><div class="inline_ornament"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#x00A9;</span> </div>&emsp;&emsp;High engagement leads to high expectations.</h2>
<p>Picture a robot on your desk or kitchen table, something you play with and talk to every day. What can it do? What do you talk about? If your answer is <em>"the same 15 jokes and maybe 55 topics on flashcards"</em> &hellip; well &hellip; you're in luck, but you're also not the readership I had in mind. </p>
<p>To put it simply, the more you ask from your audience, the more you have to give in return. If a robot cannot continue to respond in interesting ways, then people will stop interacting with it. Calm robotics embraces this fact and seeks a lower engagement from the start, in order to meet or exceed expectations at the level of the possible.</p>
<h2><div class="inline_ornament"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#x00A9;</span> </div>&emsp;&emsp;It's hard to get comfortable with a thing that's easily ruined or broken.</h2>
<p>Our most 'companionable' objects, i.e. the things we feel most comfortable around and most attached to, tend to be things that can stand up to a lot of handling and abuse. A delicate vase might be sentimental, but you won't be comfortable with it, and you definitely won't 'interact' with it much. Similarly, a robot that breaks after falling from a table, or gets dirty in a way that's difficult/impossible to clean, is not going to encourage much familiarity.</p>
<p>Since the overriding goal of calm robotics is to promote robot companionship, it calls for an approach that allows these robots to be dropped, squished, handled, and then cleaned or repaired with a maximum of confidence. </p>
<h2><div class="inline_ornament"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#x00A9;</span> 
</div>&emsp;&emsp;It's hard to relax around a camera that's always watching, even if it has a friendly name.</h2>
<p>Okay, in fairness, I think this one is only half true. I think we're better at relaxing around cameras and microphones than perhaps we <em>should</em> be. But we are starting to recognize the dangers <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/08/22/hacked-family-robots-could-turned-weapons-spying-tools/">more and more</a>, and even when the data is used lawfully, <a href="it's reasonable to be concerned about the 'lawful' ways our ">we have concerns</a>.</p>
<p>There may be many good reasons for a robot to record its environment and ship that record elsewhere, but calm robotics is <em>my</em> concept, and I'm prepared to draw a hard line in the sand. Principle #5 is <strong>No Spying</strong>, and that means that outside explicitly labeled 'test builds', there are no third parties reviewing user data in calm robotics. No one will experience the robot's perspective if they are not there in person.</p><p>Since this may be a controversial principle, I've written more on this subject <a href="#spying">here</a>.</p>
